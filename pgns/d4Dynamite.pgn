{Welcome to the comphrensive and aggressive 1.d4 course! I wanted to provide
you with this handy repertoire overview/index so you can quickly navigate all
the options that are presented in the PGNs. Our approach will be centered
around a quick development of the queen's bishop, either to f4 or g5 (the
London and Trompowsky respectively). These are perfectly respectable
developing moves in their own right, but they have the important function of
taking play away from the main lines that Black is used to. Furthermore, in
many of the variations we will be focusing on the most surprising yet sound
and aggressive options available for us.} 1. d4 d5 {Logically controlling the
center and possibly going for historically popular defenses such as the
Queen's Gambit Declined/Accepted or the Slav.} (1... Nf6 {Combined with 1..d5,
1..Nf6 contributes to 85% of all games after 1.d4. And with good reason: both
of these moves prepare development most efficiently while controlling the
center. After Nf6 Black often goes for popular openings such as the Gruenfeld,
Kings Indian, Benoni, or Nimzo-Indian.} 2. Bg5 {The Bishop's development to g5
characterizes the opening as a Trompowsky. Already we are introducing
potential imbalance into the position by creating the possibility of doubling
Black's pawns in return for the Bishop} (2. Bf4 {Keeping with the London spirit
} g6 {Most common for Black as many 1..Nf6 players are aiming for a Kingside
fianchetto regardless of White's setup} (2... e6 {is a reasonable and solid
approach leading to typical London play after} 3. e3 {[%cal Gb1d2,Gg1f3]}) (
2... c5 $5 {is a precise move order from Black if his goal is to break up our
normal London development. We need to react accurately to meet the incoming
Qb6 and will have a look at both} 3. d5 {and} (3. dxc5 $5)) 3. Nc3 $5 {[%cal
Ge2e4] Slightly unusual for the London but this aggressive approach is all the
rage. White prepares to take over the center with e4 and to castle long. Down
the road we go for a kingside attack and checkmate Black!} Bg7 (3... d5 {
Takes a fair share of the center as well} 4. e3 (4. Qd2 {[%cal Gf4h6,Ge1c1] is
also possible, going for a very straightforward attacking setup}) 4... Bg7 5.
h4 $1 {Playing against Black's fianchetto structure}) 4. e4 d6 5. Qd2 {[%cal
Ge1c1,Gf4h6] Resembles a very good Sicilian Dragon type of position and
transposes to a Pirc. Our goal will be to castle, trade the dark square
bishops, and checkmate using the h-pawn march}) 2... Ne4 {The most common
response to avoid the capture and gain a tempo} (2... c5 {is a common approach
against the early development of the Bc1. Black often wishes to play Qb6 to
hit the vulnerable b2 pawn} 3. d5 Ne4 (3... Qb6 4. Nc3 $1 {We are not
interested in defending the pawn, instead electing for rapid development and
central control} Qxb2 5. Bd2 $44 {[%cal Ge2e4] This is a very dangerous gambit
for Black as he loses multiple tempi with the queen chasing a measly pawn}) 4.
h4 $5 {With similar intentions as 2..Ne4 3. h4!?}) (2... e6 {is very solid
from Black} 3. Nd2 {[%cal Ge2e3,Ge3e4] We keep both the options of e3 and e4
available. If we do play with e3 the play is similar to the "Closed London"} (
3. e4 {also makes sense})) (2... d5 3. Bxf6 {We take the offer to damage
Black's structure} exf6 (3... gxf6 {is more aggressive but also more risky
since Black's King may have trouble finding a safe haven} 4. e3 {[%csl Gd4,Ge3,
Gf2][%cal Gc2c4]}) 4. e3 {[%cal Gc2c4,Gg2g3] We can either play with a quick
early c4 or prepare it by playing g3-Bg2 first. We will place most of our
pawns on the dark squares to blunt Black's dark square bishop and attack on
the queenside/center where we have a pawn majority.}) (2... g6 3. Bxf6 {
This leads to sitatuions that are similar to 2..d5. We double Black's pawns
and blunt his "extra" bishop while preparing queenside/central play} exf6 4. e3
Bg7 5. g3 {[%csl Gd4,Ge3,Gf2,Gg3,Gh2][%cal Gf1g2]}) 3. h4 $5 {An interesting
and surprising idea! We gain kingside space while creating more space for the
Rh1 to join the game, especially if Black trades on g5} (3. Bf4 {is the main
move})) (1... f5 {Invites the Dutch Defense, a weapon used by ambitious and
aggressive players} 2. Bg5 $1 {Continuing in Trompowsky spirit we put pressure
on Black's development by pinning the e-pawn and eyeballing a potential Nf6.
After} (2. Qd3 $5 {[%cal Ge1c1] is a very rare line that I love to use in
blitz. The idea is to prepare 0-0-0 while eyeballing the Kingside}) 2... g6 3.
Nc3 Bg7 4. h4 $1 {[%cal Gh4h5] We adopt an aggressive approach to maximally
discomfort Black's Kingside}) (1... e6 $5 {is a flexible move that causes a
little confusion for us since we are not sure what setup Black will play.
However after} 2. Nf3 {[%cal Gc1f4,Gf4g5] We keep both options of Bf4 and Bg5
open while developing flexibly ourselves}) (1... b6 {The Owen's defense is a
hypermodern approach that offers us the center. We abandon our queen's bishop
development for now to take the offer!} 2. e4 $1 {[%csl Gd4,Ge4]}) (1... g6 {
A more respectable Owen's, Black still plays in hypermodern fashion. We accept
a transposition to the Modern with} 2. e4 $1 {[%csl Gd4,Ge4]}) (1... d6 2. e4
$1 {I can't help but take all the free central space} Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {
Transposes to the Pirc but} (3... e5 {The Philidor has its adherents} 4. Nge2)
4. Bf4 {[%cal Gd1d2] transposes to our anti 1..Nf6 repertoire}) (1... c5 2. d5
{Again we diverge from our setup a bit to take over the center and punish Black
}) (1... e5 $6 {is a dubious gambit that is pretty popular online and amongst
some tricky players. We are going to take the free pawn and learn the
refutation after} 2. dxe5) 2. Bf4 {I would say Black has 3 types of main
approaches here: play a closed setup with an early e6, play for c5, or play
for developing the Bc8 bishop. We will have a look at all the approaches as
well as the side options in this course} (2. Bg5 $5 {is known as the
"Pseudo-Tromp" and we will have a quick look at this bonus option as well.})
2... Nf6 (2... c5 3. e4 $5 {Is a reversed Albin-Counter gambit with an extra
tempo. This gambit gives us rapid development and is quite rare; a good
surprise!} (3. e3 {[%cal Gc2c3] is the normal London move})) 3. e3 e6 {I
decided to refer to this setup as the "Closed London" and is a popular setup
from Black. However I also think it is a dangerous setup for Black since he
risks being passive with the Bc8 locked away} (3... c5 4. dxc5 $5 {This greedy
approach is not so easy for Black to meet as we can often just keep the pawn
after b4} (4. c3 {Again goes for the more typical London triangle setup})) (
3... Bf5 4. c4 {[%csl Rb7][%cal Gd1b3] When Black brings the bishop outside
the pawn chain we strike with c4 and prepare either Qb3 or Qa4. Here Qb3 is
very potent as the b7 pawn will be surprisingly awkward for Black to defend})
4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 {[%csl Gc3,Gd4,Ge3] Establishing the well known London
triangle central setup} Nc6 6. Ngf3 (6. Bd3 $5 {is an interesting shortcut
move order option that hopes for} Bd6 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. f4 $1 {[%csl Gc3,Gd4,Ge3,
Gf4] Building a Stonewall formation without the bad bishop that is often stuck
on c1}) 6... Bd6 (6... Be7 {Looks reasonable but already may put Black in an
uncomfortable position} 7. Ne5 {[%cal Gf1d3] We plonk the knight on e5 and
prepare to continue developing with Bd3. Black often castles short and has to
deal with a powerful attack}) 7. Bg3 O-O 8. Bd3 b6 {Depending on your
opponents knowledge and skill this position could be reached quite often and
is a "tabiya". My main recommendation is the central confrotation with} 9. e4
$1 (9. Qe2 {[%cal Ga1d1,Ge3e4] is possible as well to prepare a later e4}) (9.
Ne5 {[%cal Gf2f4] is a very London like idea as we control e5 and prepare the
stonewall setup with f4 next}) *

{Welcome! We are going to start our journey into the London System. Our piece
configuration is going to to start out solidly and unassuming: D4, Bf4, e3,
Nd2, c3, Bd3, Ngf3. However, we are going to quickly spring our pieces forward

and passive approach where Black keeps his Bc8 inside the pawn chain.} 1. d4 d5

we have examined no less than 4 options for White against Black's setup! First
of all there is the "shortcut" method of delaying Nf3 in order to play an
improved Stonewall with Bxd6 and f4. There were some deviations to the main
line position on move 9 where we need to watch out for Black playing e5. This
is often accomplished through the help of the Stonewall style Ne5+f4. After 9..
b6 we have three options: 9. e4! is my main recommendation that contains a lot
of traps and gives us very dangerous attacking chances. However Qe2 is also
interesting to prepare a later e4 or 9. Ne5 to setup our regular stonewall
approach} *

Summary: This chapter dealt with some unusual but strong ideas from Black.
First of all there is the modern cxd4 w/Nh5 idea to gain control of the f4
square. In response we can either go for an aggressive pawn sacrifice with 10.
g4!?. 10. Nd3 w/Be2 or g3 is an option for gentler souls. Black also has a
tricky move order with an early b6 which could either transpose to last
chapter or give us the chance to play an early e4 break. Finally, the Qc7 w/
Nd7 setup is new and annoying. Let's annoy it back either with my 8. dxc5!? or
the extremely new idea of 8. Rc1 w/b4!!} *

quite logical as Black puts pressure on our center and prepares ideas of Qb6

Summary: We have examined both 2.. c5 and 3.. c5 and I have two very sharp
suggestions for you: 3. e4!? and 4. dxc5!. The reverse Albin sacrifices a pawn
for a central wedge and rapid development. On the other hand 4. dxc5 is a
challenging pawn grab where Black is at risk of either being down a pawn or
being steamrolled on the queenside. Depending on Black's level, the dxc5 line
can get very complicated but studying the complications will ensure we get the
upperhand in the mayhem} *

c5 tries from Black. When Black plays 2.. c5 we need to watch out for sneaky
move orders like the early f6 or Bf5. Of course we also need to know that the
trap with Qb6+Bf5 doesn't work at all since we can trap the queen in the
corner! In general Qb3 is a good way to meet Qb6. Elsewhere we analyzed the
Carlsbad structure for some thematic attacking ideas. Lastly, remember that
Bf5/Bg4 activate the bishop but also allow us ideas such as Qb3/Qa4 or Nh4} *

we can play positionally by going short and playing for the e5 square and
queenside attack OR we can use the very aggressive Qc2 (h3) g4 attack. Nc6
setups are pretty common from players who are just looking at developing moves
but after an early c4 we will control a lot of the center and eventually get
good queenside play} *

Wijk aan Zee 2016 Summary: I have to admit the tricky part about the "Queens
Indian London" is that Black has a couple of move orders; will be play c5 b6
or be7? However we should be well equipped to deal with all of these. First
off against an early b6 we can try the rare Qf3!? and long castle. An early
Be7 is solid and flexible and may transpose to other lines, but don't forget
the possibility of playing Nd2-Nc4!. An early c5 can lead to the dubious Qb6
when Na3! exploits the wandering queen. Another trick is that an early c5+b6
is met with Nc3! which threatens d5 and Nb5. Lastly if you are confused you
can always stick to London style setups with C3/d4/e3 center triangle and Nd2/
Nf3/Bd3 development. That's what Magnus Carlsen did to crush a 2730!} *

Doha 2016 Summary: The Nf6+g6 approach is very popular and I would definitely
advise to look over this chapter with care! First off after our Nc3!? idea
Black must already decided if he wants to play d6 or d5. I think d5 is much
stronger as d6 allows us a very easy attacking plan on the kingside. True,
Black has the c6-Qa5 idea but I think very few players will know it. Even then
I found a very rare and extremely dangerous idea for Black that requires
immaculate defense to remain in the game. In the main line after d5 our idea
is to play e3 w/h4 and even consider a sacrifice with h5! Usually Black will
block it with h5 or h6 after which we should try to install a knight on e5.
Black's best bet is a well timed c5 strike. However if he plays c5 too early
we can play Nb5! to force Na6} *

including queenside pawn storms and the central e3-e4. Make sure to take note
of the special move order gambit trick after 3..h6 4. Bh4 c5 5. e4! which is
very dangerous for Black! Finally if Black plays an early d5 we would be well
advised to follow in the World Champion's footsteps by playing the accelerated
Stonewall setup with f4 & Bxf6! Then a pawn storm crowns a brilliant game.} *

have completed the journey of the D4 Nf6 Trompowsky and have examined some of
the most critical and sharp lines from Black. After 2..c5 the game can go into
the "Vaganian Gambit" which to my eyes looks very impractical for Black. After
a quick f4 we are menacing the e5 break and Black must take extreme care not
to lose from the opening. After 2..Ne4 I propose the quirky h4!? which looks
to activate the Rh1. Black's best bet is to play calmly with d5 after which we
can reach roughly equal positions with more space on the kingside. Otherwise
if Black insists on playing aggressively with c5 and Qb6 we can sacrifice one
or even two pawns for a massive intiative.} *

2017 Summary: Trompowsky deviations on move 2 are not too spectacular and in
most cases we will take on f6 with a rough transposition to chapter 11. We
also looked at the option of playing a Trompowsky against d4. It's possible
but Black has some strong options like the early c5 as well as f6. Try at your
own risk!} *

The Dutch is an aggressive and unique opening and our normal London or
Trompowsky style responses aren't exactly possible. I offer you two options:
the rare 2. Qd3!? which seeks gambit style play with g4 or the more main
stream 2. Bg5! Although this move has some similarities to the Trompowsky, I
chose it more because of its objective value! Black is denied simple
development and must defend against aggressive ideas such as e4 or h4-h5
attacks.} *

{Congratulations! You have made it to the "odds & ends" section of the course.
Of course in order to have a complete repertoire we need to round out some of
these pesky move 1 options. Some of these are a bit tricky since its hard to
stay in our "systems" but we are never short of good moves even if they are
not exactly in line with our repertoire. Anyway, lets dive in!} 1. d4 e6 $5 {

the whole center so we are going to take it! If you're thinking, "Hey I'm a d4

best move by far here!} Bg7 3. Nf3 {The simplest solution is to defend the

at various ideas against d4. Against passive moves like g6/d6/b6 I simply
recommend e4 to take the center. More tricky is 1..c5 and 1..e6. Against c5 I
think the best option is to play d5 and proceed with extra space in a complex
position. 1..e6 can be a little tricky with the move orders but we can be
tricky ourselves by delaying castling and launching a vicious attack with g4!}
